# Overview

This is the project weâ€™re going to build services for a web application
similar to reddit.

# How to run the services:

The test environment for this project in this course is a Tuffix VM with
Python 3.6.7

Following these steps to install neccessary packages:
1. Install python:
sudo apt-get install python3
2. Install pip3:
sudo apt install python3-pip
3. Install flask:
pip3 install flask

Following these steps to start the services:
1. Open terminal in the project folder
2. Executing a linux command:
	python3 createdb.py
		>> to create new database named "project1.db"
3. Executing a linux command:
	python3 micro1.py
		>> to run microservice 1
4. Open another terminal
4. Executing a linux command:
	python3 micro2.py
		>> to run microservice 1

# How to open the database to test changes
1. Open terminal and execute a linux command to install package "sqlitebrowser"
	sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser
2. In Tuffix windows, search and open the package named "DB  Browser for SQLite"
3. In the project folder, drag the file named "project1.db" to the window "DB  Browser for SQLite"
4. Check tables in database if neccessary


# Test micro services
1. Install Postman application
    - https://www.postman.com

2. Import the "collections" and "global environmentals" (basic_test.json, excess_test.json, bogus_test.json, neg_test.json, and postman_globals.json) to inspect or modify postman requests

3. Install Docker
    - https://docs.docker.com

4. Install Docker Compose
    - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install

5. Open docker-compose.yml with a text editor and change "volume" directory to where source files are located; additional information and configuration in the docker-compose.yml file

6. Run micro services on localhost; docker is configured to connect to micro services outside of containers

7. Execute and test with no load (postman/newman image should be pulled from docker repository automatically)
    - $ docker-compose up

8. Test with load
    - $ docker-compose up --scale excess_test=<number of containers or "simulated users">

9. Check docker compose logs
    - $ docker-compose logs basic_test
    - $ docker-compose logs bogus_test
    - $ docker-compose logs neg_test

10. Save logs to file
    - $ docker-compose logs --no-color basic_test > basic_test_log.txt
    - $ docker-compose logs --no-color bogus_test > bogus_test_log.txt
    - $ docker-compose logs --no-color neg_test > neg_test_log.txt

11. Stop and remove running containers
    - $ docker-compose down
